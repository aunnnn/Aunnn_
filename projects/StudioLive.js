    <h3>Problem</h3>

    <p>This app was born because no other apps that let me scrubbing through frames and preview the animation.</p>

    <p>In most apps, you have to slide through frames, then click it to show up on the canvas. This two-step process is very slow.</p>

    <p>With this app you can iterate quickly. Tap the ‘+’ to append new frame at the end. You can also see the previous frame faded in the background. The scrubbing panel at the bottom is the best way to preview your work.</p>
